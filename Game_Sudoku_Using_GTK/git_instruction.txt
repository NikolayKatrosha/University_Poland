For installing you have to create your work folder
Then write in VS Code in Terminal the following:
1. git clone <git repository name>
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "your commit"
4. BEFORE 
git push -u origin main 
You need to send me your GIT Name so i`ll be able to add you as a colloborator
